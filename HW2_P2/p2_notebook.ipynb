    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this project, we do corner detection and feature matching. We implement [Harris algorithm](http://www.bmva.org/bmvc/1988/avc-88-023.pdf) to do corner detection, and as described in the paper, we use a 2-d Gaussian as a smooth circular window at the second step.  \n",
    "Then we will implement feature matching based on SSD (sum of squared distnces) and Mutual Marriages.\n",
    "> Mutual Marraiges: Suppose image ​I1​ yields corners ​d = {(x​1​,y​1)​ , ..., (xn​ ​,y​n​)}​ and image ​I​2​ yields corners ​s = {(x1​ ​,y1​ )​ , ..., (x​m,​ y​m)​ }​. When looking at corner ​d​i​ = (x​i,​ y​i​)​, we look at all of the corners in ​s​ and take the corner with the best SSD match score. Then, we do the same for all features in ​s​ to find the best matches in ​d​. To retrieve ​good​ matches, they must agree, such that if ​di​ ​ finds ​sj​ ​ as its best match, then when searching for matches in ​s​ then ​s​j better also choose ​d​i​ as its best match or this wasn’t a good match. In this way, they agree on each other and we can reduce ambiguous matches and arbitrary distance thresholding.\n",

    "*Notes about the reference functions and our results: they are just for reference and your results do NOT have to be exactly the same; but when there are some discrepencies, you may want to double check the correctness of your code, make sure your code is doing the right thing while the discrepencies are caused by some trivial details of the implementation, and try to find alternative reference functions to compare with (e.g. cv2.getGaussianKernel for Q2)*"
